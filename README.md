# sonar-scala
Sonarqube plugin for scala analysis

# Set-up
Intended for sonarqube 5.4

Download the latest relase into your sonar extensions/downloads folder.
Restart sonarqube either using the update center or manually.

The rules in scalastyle are almost all deactivated. They must be activated and either make scala rules inherit scalastyle rules or change the project's rules.

For more information about either scalastyle rules or scoverage results please consult their upstream documentation first:

* [NCR-CoDE/sonar-scalastyle](https://github.com/NCR-CoDE/sonar-scalastyle)
* [RadoBuransky/sonar-scoverage-plugin](https://github.com/RadoBuransky/sonar-scoverage-plugin)

# Build from source
```mvn package```

# Test
```
mvn test
sonar-runner -D sonar.projectKey=Sagacify:sonar-scala
```

# Contributing
Contributions wre accepted in the form of a pull request or a signed patch.
Please follow the semantic changelog to format your commits [cfr](https://github.com/Sagacify/komitet-gita-bezopasnosti).
All changes are submitted to automated tests that must pass for the pull-request to be merged.

# Info
This plugin is not an evolution from the legacy sonar-scala-plugin of which versions can be found laying around such as [1and1/sonar-scala](https://github.com/1and1/sonar-scala).
The previous plugin used the scala compiler to create its metrics which had the disadvantage of requiring a specific plugin per scala version.
Instead, we are using the [scala-ide/scalariform](https://github.com/scala-ide/scalariform) library to parse the source code in a version independent way.

# TODO (by priority)
* Add property to sepcify scala version (currently defaults to 2.11.8)
* Add Complexity metric on file (use the one in scalastyle)
* remove dependency on commons-io (Currently only needed by BruteForceSequenceMatcher)
* Uncomment ScoverageSensorSpec
* Integrate other java compatible code quality tools
* Optimize sensors i.e. (scalastyle and base both read and parse source files.)

Many existing projects have been used as inspiration.
Here is a list of the main ones.

# Integration
For ease of use, Sonar Scala directly integrates the latest code from the [Sonar Scalastyle Plugin](https://github.com/NCR-CoDE/sonar-scalastyle) and  [Sonar Scoverage Plugin](https://github.com/RadoBuransky/sonar-scoverage-plugin). This is possible as all three projects are released under the LGPL3 license. Nevertheless, all merged files are to keep their original copyright, classpath, and commit history. Any further change upstream should be incorporated using cherry-picks or merges.
